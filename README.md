Building
========

The Python Cheetah template engine is used for creating the svg files. It lets me use variables and 
helper functions for creating the SVGs. Install it and then run "make".

Laser cutter instructions
=========================

When loading the SVGs into CorelDraw, make the following modifications to the artwork:

1. Select all lines and set them to "Hairline"
2. If using the Epilog, make the lines black instead of red
3. Modify the page size to 24"x12"
4. Move the origin to the top left of the page
